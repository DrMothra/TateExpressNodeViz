                <h3>Updating a Node</h3>
                <p>
                    Here you'll see the name of the graph that you are modifying along with the graph id that has been entered for you, you could
                    change this if wanted to modify another graph and you happened to know the relevant ID.
                    Enter the name of the node that you'd like to update, there is an auto-complete option enabled so that you should be able to see the node that you are interested in,
                    and click Get Links.<br>
                    This will then show you all the links in the graph that come <b>from</b> the node in question. <i>If you want to alter the relationship of a node that goes to your node in question, then
                    enter that node in the Node Name text box and click Get Links again.</i><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Modify Graph button will take you back to the Modify options whilst the Home button will let you see all the graphs available.
