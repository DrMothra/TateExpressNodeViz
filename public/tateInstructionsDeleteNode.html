                <h3>Deleting a node</h3>
                <p>
                    Enter the name of the node that you would like to delete - there is an auto-complete option available. Then click the
                    Find button. This will search for all the nodes in the graph that have the given name (nodes can have the same name if they are
                    of differing types).
                    There will be a list of matching nodes displayed along with the relevant type so as to ensure that you are deleting the correct object.
                    Simply select the checkbox next to the node that you want to delete and then press the delete button.
                    If the node has been successfully deleted then you will see an appropriate message.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Modify Graph button will take you back to the Modify options whilst the Home button will let you see all the graphs available.
