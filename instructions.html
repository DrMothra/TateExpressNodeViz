                <h3>Current Graphs</h3>
                <p>
                    When the app first loads you'll see a list of the current graphs in the Tate Graph Commons account (see image below).<br>
                    This list consists of the name of the graph and its asscoietd graph ID (this is just a unique string of characters that identifies the graph - you may need this number later).<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you'd like to make modifications to any of the existing graphs then just click the Modify button and you'll be taken to a new page (the modify instructions are detailed below). <br>
                </p>
                <h3>Creating and generating a new graph</h3>
                <p>
                    If you'd like to generate a completely new graph then you'll need to supply a name for the graph and an optional description.<br>
                    Once you've entred these then just click on New Graph and a new graph will be created in the Graph Commons account with the graph ID indicated.<br>
                </p>
                <img src="public/images/instruct2.jpg">
                <p>
                    This just creates an empty graph, we need to add some content.<br>
                    At this point you could just go the Graph Commons account and start adding items to the newly-created graph, which is absolutely fine. Alternatively if you have a lot of exisitng data that
                    you'd like to add to the graph then a better way is to use a spreadsheet file.<br>
                    From your spreadsheet file, save the file as a csv file (this stands for comma separated values - as it says all the data just separated with commas, very straightforward). If you then select
                    the Choose File option and locate your csv file, load it and then hit the
                    Generate graph button, the app will then create all the necessary nodes and links that form your graph.<br>
                    If you need a sample file to test, you can download one <a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~psztg1/Documentation/TateCartography.csv">here</a>.<br>
                    An indication of how this is progressing is given towards the bottom of the page, denoting how many nodes and links are going to be generated and the current progress.<br>
                </p>
                <img src="public/images/instruct3.jpg">
                <p>
                    When this is all done you'll see an appropriate message and you should be able to see your graph in the graph commons account.
                </p>
                <h3>Modifying a graph</h3>
                <p>
                    If you have selected the Modify option for your graph then you'll be presented with the options to update your graph or add new elements to it.<br>
                    Currently this consists of emphasizing the links between nodes, adding new nodes or adding new relationships between existing nodes.<br>
                </p>
                <h3>Updating a node</h3>
                <p>
                    If you select the Update Node option then you'll need to enter the name of the node that you'd like to update. The graph ID that we are concerned with has been entered for you, but you could
                    change this if wanted to modify another graph and you happened to know the relevant ID.<br>
                    Enter the name of the node that you'd like to see the details for (for example Tania Brugera) and click Search.<br>
                    This will then show you all the links in the graph that come <b>from</b> the node in question. <i>If you want to alter the relationship of a node that goes to your node in question, then
                    enter that node in the Node Name text box and Search again.</i><br>
                </p>
                <img src="public/images/instruct4.jpg">
                <p>
                    You will now see all the links that come from your designated node (if there are any). Next to each link is a Agree and Disagree button. Clicking Agree will indicate that you'd like this link to
                    look more pronounced in the graph. Once you've clicked Agree you can go to the Graph Commons account, reload your graph, and you should now see that the line connecting the nodes for the given
                    relationship has become thicker (or it has a greater weight if you prefer). Continually clicking on the Agree option will make this line thicker still. Bare in mind that the current weight limits for
                    a link are between 1 and 10, hence there is no point in clicking Agree more than 10 times to show your approval. The exact same process works for the Disagree option, once again note that once the
                    line has reached it's minimum thickness there is no point in clicking further.<br>
                    You can click the Home button to go back to the start or the browsers back button to modify a node further.
                </p>
                <h3>Adding a node</h3>
                <p>
                    If you want to add a new node to your graph then you'll need to supply a name and a type. You also need a graph ID but this has been filled in for you.<br>
                    So, if you wanted to add a new artist to the graph for example, then the node name would be the artist name and the node type would be something like Artists.<br>
                </p>
                <img src="public/images/instruct5.jpg">
                <p>
                    In future there will be a drop down list of the current types that you can choose from, so as to extend the graph without having to know the exact name of the types that currently
                    exist in the graph. You can still create a completely new type however, just by entering the type name in the text box provided.<br>
                    Once you've entered the details then click Add and your new node should be added to the graph (you receive an indication that this has happened). If you once again reload your graph in the
                    Graph Commons account you should see your new node.<br>
                    From here you can either click back to add further modifications or press the Home button to start all over again.
                </p>
                <h3>Adding a link</h3>
                <p>
                    Adding a link is a slightly more convoluted process than adding a node as there is a bit more information required to achieve it.<br>
                    In order to establish a relationship between two entities you need to supply the names of the nodes to be connected, the types of the nodes you are connecting (to ensure that you are
                    connecting the correct nodes together) and the type of link you'd like to establish. Once again the graph ID is pre-filled but can be changed if required.<br>
                </p>
                <img src="public/images/instruct6.jpg">
                <p>
                    Once you have entered all the necessary information then click the Add Link and the link should be created in the appropriate graph (you receive an indication to confirm this).<br>
                    Yet again if you reload your graph in Graph Commons you should see the new relationship created.
                </p>
                <h3>Other things to consider</h3>
                <p>
                    You'll notice that there are currently no methods to delete anything? This is deliberate for the short term as ths interface is designed to allow practitioners who do not have a Graph Commons
                    account participate in the whole graph manipulation process. Until we have a system of user accounts or something similar in place then I'm going to make the assumption that allowing people to
                    delete things may not be the best course of action. There is of course nothing stopping any project member deleting something as we all share the same account, so if you do make a mistake then
                    you can log in and rectify it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can only manipulate a graph in the project's common Graph Commons account. You can't use this interface to alter your own personal graphs (which is quite sensible!). It may also be worth
                    noting that you can share the link to the app with anyone, who can then manipulate the graphs as they see fit. This is fine, but I would ask that you don't share the login details for the
                    Graph Commons account as this may well lead to all sorts of issues and/or confusion!
